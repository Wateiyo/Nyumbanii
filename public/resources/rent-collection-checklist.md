## 🆘 Emergency Situations

### Tenant Claims Payment Was Made
1. Check all payment channels (M-Pesa, bank, cash log)
2. Ask for proof of payment (transaction ID, receipt)
3. Verify with payment provider
4. If confirmed, apologize and update records immediately
5. If not found, request tenant to resend or make new payment

### Tenant Loses Job/Emergency
1. Listen with empathy
2. Review lease terms for hardship provisions
3. Offer realistic payment plan (e.g., 50% now, 50% in 15 days)
4. Put agreement in writing
5. Monitor compliance strictly

### Multiple Tenants Late Simultaneously
1. Check if there's a system issue (e.g., M-Pesa down)
2. Send mass communication about alternative payment methods
3. Extend grace period if issue is beyond tenant control
4. Process individual cases fairly
5. Learn from incident to improve payment system

## ✅ Monthly Review Questions

At the end of each month, ask yourself:

- [ ] What was our collection rate this month?
- [ ] Which tenants were consistently late?
- [ ] Are our payment methods convenient enough?
- [ ] Did we follow up promptly on late payments?
- [ ] What can we improve next month?
- [ ] Are our late fees effective or too harsh?
- [ ] Should we adjust our screening process?
